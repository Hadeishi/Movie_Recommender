    "## Tokenizing and TF-IDF Vectorization:  Text-based Cosine Similarity\n",
    "#### In this notebook, I will process the text data to each movie, doing final cleaning of punctuation, making all words lowercase and spliting text into individual word \"tokens\" (N.B., for those who are text processing-savvy, this was done outside of Vectorizers in order to retain the '-', since curse words are represented in these reviews as s--t and f--k. The frequency with which these curse words appear in reviews may be an important text feature for parents).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenized text will then be vectorized using TF-IDF Vectorizer. TF-IDF Vectorizer will take the frequency of words found in text and divide by the frequency with which each term appears in all documents put together. This technique is designed to give greater weight to terms that occur frequently in a document but not in other documents, thus controlling for words that appear frequently in all movies--- such as the word, \"movie,\" for example. It will then turn the TF-IDF statistic into the movie's \"word vector.\" These word vectors will then be run through Truncated SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Truncated SVD is a procedure designed to capture the most variance in our collected movie word vectors using the fewest possible components. Each component is a linear combination of word vectors, each word contributing to each component by a particular positive or negative weight (see below for examples). I will then analyze these components to see if I can derive some meaning from the words that contribute to them (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once we get our text data into truncatedSVD format, I will then use cosine similarity to determine which movies are most similar to which other movies in our data set. Cosine similarity is a procedure whereby movies whose associated text contains similar words will be described by vectors that \"point in similar directions,\" if you will, through the vector space defined by truncatedSVD. Movies with vectors that point in similar directions will have higher cosine similarities and so will be deemed to be similar according to this movie recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We will then also incorporate non-text data to see how this improves our cosine similarity-based similarity matrix (see below)."

Even after SVD transformation, these coefficients are slightly positive. \n",

The words that contribute least to our component appear to be mostly typos. This first component, then, is probably best interpreted as representing words of little specific meaning and should be ignored.\n",

For example, Component 8 above (numbered 7 since our components are zero indexed) represents could be called \"Real World Things of importance to Stereotypical Guys.\" Dogs, war, team, school, and sports all load strongly on this component, while magic, fantasy, horror, fairy, scary, and for some reason love all load negatively. Similarly, component 2 above might be called \"Things With Positive Emotional Valence to Puritanical Parents\" with Christmas, kids, santa, holiday, dog, and family being the highest positive contributors to the component while nudity, violence, women, shown, drug, and sexual being the highest negative contributors. As recognizers of patterns, we can easily derive meaning from these components; a useful lesson in semiotics."
